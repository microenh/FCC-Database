# FCC Database

This is a SwiftUI program to download the FCC US Amateur Radio Callsign database and look up callsigns. The program can download the latest FCC database on demand. The program uses reverse geocoding to determine the latitude and longitude of the station (based on the address) and displays the station location on a panable and zoomable map as well as distance and heading from a set location.
